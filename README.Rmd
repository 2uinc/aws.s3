# AWS S3 Client Package #

**aws.s3** is a simple client package for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) REST API. While [other packages](https://github.com/ropensci/webservices#amazon) currently connect R to S3, they do so incompletely (mapping only some of the API endpoints to R) and most implementations rely on the AWS command-line tools, which users may not have installed on their system.
